# Linear-Regression-Coursera-ML
Coursera

This is the first programming assignment from Coursera course: Machine Learning Standford University
Specifically, take a look at: <br>
<br>
  1- computeCost.m <br>
  2- gradientDescent.m  <br>
  <br>
Those are the real meat of the assignment and nicely demonstrate the application of Linear Algebra in machine learning.
